Create users in jenkins 


1) Manage jenkins -> manage users -> created two users (developer1 and tester1)

2) Go to plugins and install role-based authorization strategy plugin 

3) restart your jenkins

4) manage jenkins -> configure global security -> under authorization select -> role based stategy

5) when you try to login into jenkins frm any of the account you will not be able to login because of the missing parameters

6) now again login as admin

7) Manage jenkins -> Manage and assign roles -> manage roles -> add a role 
e.g developerrole -> (overall read and give compete  job access)
testerrole -> (overall read and give only read access of job)

Save

8) Click on assign roles and put developer1 and assign developerrole and create tester1 and assign testerole

9) now logout from jenkins and login as a developer and you will see some point missing ...as you cannot manage jenkins that permission is not given

10) logout and login and tester1 and check if you can create a job (you will not be able to create because you have just read access only)


Assignment : Create a user which just have an access to manage jenkins but no access to the jobs !!
